            <h2>About Prime GNU/Linux</h2>
            <p>One of the definitions for prime is <em>to make ready or prepare</em></p>
            <p>Prime GNU/Linux mirrors the design goals of the original Core Linux system which is to produce "a minimal distribution of the GNU/Linux operating system designed to be the basis for a complete system constructed by the end user. A fresh installation... will boot into a console and provide the user with the tools needed to download, compile and install other applications. [It] contains nothing beyond what is required to perform these tasks. [It] is primarily designed for experienced GNU/Linux users, though it has found an audience with those looking to learn about the internals and operation of a GNU/Linux system." (This is the description of Core when version 1 was originally released on April 4, 2003 by Josh Devan.)</p>
            <p>Distributions such as [K,X]Ubuntu, OpenSuse, Fedora and others are becoming more and more mainstream in the desktop arena and easier to install than ever.</p>
            <p>With this popularity you also get the software bloat effect where the average distribution is now available on a minimum of 3 plus CD's or even multiple DVDs. Rich desktop environments are installed to give the average user the desktop experience they know and understand from a Microsoft Windows or Apple MacOS environment.</p>
            <p>This is happening to the point where the average user does not even have a chance of knowing what all is installed during the installation process. Newer installation routines give the user little chance to customize what is being installed on their system.</p>
            <p>So the question is: <em>what was installed that is using 2 GBs of your hard drive?</em></p>
            <p>These recent developments on the desktop have also carried over to the server environment where installations provide a multifunction server environment, and often installing too much bloatware for the purpose of the server.</p>
            <p>The developers of Core 2 (the update for the original Core Linux project) want to go back to the basics - keeping GNU/Linux the way it was known to the community: <em>a versatile and customizable operating system which can be optimized for the planned operation thus preparing/priming a system for its main purpose.</em></p>
